Energy companies do unbearable things, in collaboration with others, at different spatial scales across historical and biological time. We who live by gasoline and electricity do not normally see the oil and coal and uranium that power our autos and homes, just as we do not normally see the iron ore and chemical feedstocks that underlie our everyday consumption and agency. Trains rumble, steam vents, generators hum, factories clatter and life goes on.

But some days the wind blows. The earth trembles, the waves rise, cracks open up in the street. A seal fails, a wheel breaks, a spark jumps, there is an explosion. Some days the things we do not usually perceive take center stage. Distant operations and their unwanted consequences become evident to the naked eye. What was invisible appears in the form of an acccident. The far collapses into the near, the past and present intermingle; the future threatens and the body remembers.

This map is about a day when the wind blew in Chicago. Clouds of noxious dust arose from gritty black piles stocked in huge quantities along the Calumet river. Residents choked on something called petcoke. The tar sands, we realized, were on our hands. The Koch brothers were in our lungs and in our faces.

This map is about that day, about that dust. It's about the BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana. It's about the train tracks and steel mills and chemical plants that paint the landscape of South Chicago. It's about the Bakken crude and the Athabascan slurry in our gas tanks. It's about the derricks and pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico. This map is about earth time and an explosion that has not yet happened. This map is about Petropolis.
