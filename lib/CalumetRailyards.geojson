Additional crude is shifted from pipeline to rail by Buckeye Terminals. The business is highly profitable and safety regulations are actively combatted by management.",

If you don’t believe that, consider that one of the railroad’s most exciting new business markets involves transporting crude oil from North Dakota shale fields to refineries on the East Coast.'</em><br>Another exciting thing they don't mention is that the Bakken crude from the North Dakota shale-oil wells is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPVRRgAtL4A' target='_blank'>highly explosive</a>, with numerous derailments to prove it. Norfolk Southern and its close competitior, CSX, send up to 60 oil trains to New York and Pennsylvania refineries each week, as revealed in <a href='http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/economy/article24774373.html' target='_blank'>documents obtained against the companies' will</a>. Each 'bomb train' is typically about 100 cars long. Most of the Bakken crude headed to the East Coast is brought to Chicago by BNSF and Canadian National, then transferred to Norfolk Southern and CSX lines. Additional crude is shifted from pipeline to rail by Buckeye Terminals. The long black tanker trains are a common sight in the city. One of them could easily explode in a densely populated neighborhood.",
