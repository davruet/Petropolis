"website": "On this site, KCBX Terminals, aka the infamous Koch Brothers, runs a petcoke stockpile that poisons the neighborhood with dust before poisoning the world when it is ultimately burned as fuel. Tar sands oil produces huge quantities of it. The business model of the Kochs is to buy up cheap industrial junk and use it 'till bust. In this case they saw the tar sands bonanza coming, so they bought an abandoned steel site with a train track and a river dock in order to trade in dirty energy right in the middle of a populated neighborhood. Material is brought in by train and barge from the Citgo and ExxonMobile refineries located to the southeast, then shipped out by train, barge or freighter. It is said to go to foreign buyers, but no one really knows. It was probably obvious to Koch company managers that people in the area would protest against this business, and it was also probably obvious that they could make a lot of money in the interim. For more, read the materials linked below and look at the other open pile sites marked on this map. The struggle is still ongoing.<br>",
